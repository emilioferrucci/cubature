# Degree-7 cubature on Wiener space

Implementation for degree-7 cubature on Wiener space, based on our paper [1]. 

The Gaussian cubature formulae are taken from [2]. The calculations in the free Lie algebra and tensor Hopf algebra are based on [3].

A demo of how cubature in degree 3, 5 and 7 can be found in the notebook cubature_plots.ipynb .
